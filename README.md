## Implementation
- React is used for the front end of the application, while the back end is handled by a custom Rails API ([see API code here](https://github.com/rafaelhrtd/abacont-backend))
- AXIOS calls are made to the API, which uses JWT and devise for authentication.
- Access privileges are managed in the back end through a CanCan implementation.
